Sophisticated. Modern. Open Source. Gorgeously machined aluminum with a subtle pulsating LED. Perfect for Father's day or for that geek who loves technology and needs to get dressed up for a special event. Welcome to the future!

This is a new type of product for Adafruit, we want to create wearable electronics that are subtle, fun to wear and look classy. We started with cufflinks and now have a [necklace version](http://www.adafruit.com/products/440) available too.

The cufflinks are CNC machined from the finest 6 series aluminum for durability and beauty. The iCufflinks are a remarkable accessory. Machined with a "screw in backing". Each iCufflink contains a circuit board with pulsating LED and battery.

### Reverse engineered
The "pulsing" is similar to the "breathing" LED pattern on many laptop and computer systems. The default pattern is [reverse engineered](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/08/26/reverse-engineering-the-mac-breathing-led-2/) from the Apple "breathing" LED on Macs, MacBooks, iMacs, etc.

### Open source
Cufflinks are completely open source. [The source code, circuit board files, schematics and CAD files are posted on GitHub. Mod & Hack away! Cufflinks can be reprogrammed to any pattern you'd like!](https://github.com/adafruit/iCufflinks).

### Ready to go
Before your fancy event, just pop the battery in, screw the backing and your iCufflinks will gently pulsate for up to 72 hours. Each order comes with 2 sets of batteries, simply replace them when the LED is too dim to see. We sell replacement batteries as well.

### Designed and made in North America
Cufflinks are lovingly machined in Toronto, Canada by Ross + Doell, assembled in New York, New York USA. Created by Mike Doell, Limor Fried and Phillip Torrone.
